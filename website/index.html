                <h2>What is VPN?</h2>
                <p>A virtual private network (VPN) gives you online privacy and anonymity by creating a private network
                    from a public internet connection. VPNs mask your internet protocol (IP) address so your online
                    actions are virtually untraceable. Most important, VPN services establish secure and encrypted
                    connections to provide greater privacy than even a secured Wi-Fi hotspot.</p>

                <h3>Why do you need a VPN service?</h3>
                <p>Surfing the web or transacting on an unsecured Wi-Fi network means you could be exposing your private
                    information and browsing habits. That’s why a virtual private network, better known as a VPN, should
                    be a must for anyone concerned about their online security and privacy.</p>
                <p>Think about all the times you’ve been on the go, reading emails while in line at the coffee shop, or
                    checking your bank account while waiting at the doctor’s office. Unless you were logged into a
                    private Wi-Fi network that requires a password, any data transmitted during your online session
                    could be vulnerable to eavesdropping by strangers using the same network.</p>

                <h3>How a VPN protects your IP address and privacy</h3>
                <p>VPNs essentially create a data tunnel between your local network and an exit node in another
                    location, which could be thousands of miles away, making it seem as if you’re in another place. This
                    benefit allows online freedom, or the ability to access your favorite apps and websites while on the
                    go.</p>
                <p>Here’s a closer look at how a virtual private network works. VPNs use encryption to scramble data
                    when it’s sent over a Wi-Fi network. Encryption makes the data unreadable. Data security is
                    especially important when using a public Wi-Fi network, because it prevents anyone else on the
                    network from eavesdropping on your internet activity.</p>
                <p>There’s another side to privacy. Without a VPN, your internet service provider can know your entire
                    browsing history. With a VPN, your search history is hidden. That’s because your web activity will
                    be associated with the VPN server’s IP address, not yours. A VPN service provider may have servers
                    all over the world. That means your search activity could appear to originate at any one of them.
                    Keep in mind, search engines also track your search history, but they’ll associate that information
                    with an IP address that’s not yours. Again, your VPN will keep your online activity private.</p>
                <h3>VPN privacy: What does a VPN hide?</h3>
                <h5>1. Your browsing history</h5>
                <p>It’s no secret where you go on the internet. Your internet service provider and your web browser can
                    track just about everything you do on the internet. A lot of the websites you visit can also keep a
                    history. Web browsers can track your search history and tie that information to your IP address.</p>
                <h5>2. Your IP address and location</h5>
                <p>Anyone who captures your IP address can access what you’ve been searching on the internet and where
                    you were located when you searched. Think of your IP address as the return address you’d put on a
                    letter. It leads back to your device.</p>
                <h5>3. Your location for streaming</h5>
                <p>You might pay for streaming services that enable you to watch things like professional sports. When
                    you travel outside the country, the streaming service may not be available. There are good reasons
                    for this, including contractual terms and regulations in other countries. Even so, a VPN would allow
                    you to select an IP address in your home country. That would likely give you access to any event
                    shown on your streaming service. You may also be able to avoid data or speed throttling.</p>
                <h5>4. Your devices</h5>
                <p>A VPN can help protect your devices, including desktop computer, laptop, tablet, and smart phone from
                    prying eyes. Your devices can be prime targets for cybercriminals when you access the internet,
                    especially if you’re on a public Wi-Fi network. In short, a VPN helps protect the data you send and
                    receive on your devices so hackers won’t be able to watch your every move.</p>
                <h5>5. Your web activity — to maintain internet freedom</h5>
                <p>Hopefully, you’re not a candidate for government surveillance, but who knows. Remember, a VPN
                    protects against your internet service provider seeing your browsing history. So you’re protected if
                    a government agency asks your internet service provider to supply records of your internet activity.
                    Assuming your VPN provider doesn’t log your browsing history (some VPN providers do), your VPN can
                    help protect your internet freedom.</p>
